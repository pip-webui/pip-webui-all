Development of complex Line-of-Business (Enteprise) applications is a serious undertaking that requires effort of large groups 
including designers, developers and testers. Typical product line may consist of multiple applications, each with many pages 
and dialogs. Enterprise users pay high price for their systems and demand quality of free consumer apps they see on their devices.

There are lots of good frameworks and libraries of UI controls out there. But LOB apps are still hard to implement.
To save time and money for organizations, to make life of development and designers easier, to provide users consistent 
and high-quality UI we created a framework that provides usage patterns and high-level controls that are common
among enterprise applications. 

Through many years of experience in systems development we've been seen that interaction patterns of enterprise users 
are fairly consistent. They need to monitor and keep under control their area of responsibility, they get and analyzes 
large and complex datasets, they perform multitasking, they get interrupted when something important happens, 
they collaborate with others. Those patterns don't change with technologies, and just get more and more automated.

We collected those interactions patterns and put them into UX concept for LOB apps. The concept describes things like:
- Registration and entering a system
- Navigation through application
- Multi-tasking
- Notifications
- Application settings and user preferences
- Integrated help and user guidance
- .. and more...

Then we decided on UI design style. We found that unique design for LOB apps is a bad thing. It requires designers to constantly 
reinvent wheels, developers to implement basic controls and interactions from scratch. Users also don't like to learn it
and would rather go with familiar and well established design. Among all "standard" design styles only Google Material design
fits well all platforms, devices and form factors. 

Finally, we had to decide on implementation technologies. Choosing HTML5 was fairly straightforward since it is the only
technology that allows to develop apps "once" and run them "everywhere". Selection of higher-level framework and control 
library. But decided to go with the leader and picked **Angular** and **Angular Material** for our implementation.
