# Long-term technology sustainability

Development of complex Line-of-Business applications is a serious undertaking that requires effort of large groups including
designers, developers and testers. Typical product line may consist of multiple applications, each with many pages and dialogs.
Enterprise users pay high price for their systems and demand quality of free consumer apps they see on their devices.
However, that's hard to achieve since the technologies are changing fast, number of device types are ever increasing. 
Redeveloping complex applications for multiple platforms and migration from one technology to a newer one at such rapid pace 
is just not feasible. So, that to do?

As a part of "long-term technology sustainability" program we tried to find a solution to that problem.
In our opinion, rather then be caught by surprise by rapid changes in the world of technologies, it shall be prepared.
Business problems solved by technological solutions are not changing that fast. For conceptual approach and logical
architecture stays pretty stable. Some parts of implementation related to business logic can be abstracted and protected.
The rest can be reimplemented using well-prepared migration path.
